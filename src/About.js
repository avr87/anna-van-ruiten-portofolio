            Hi, I'm junior front-end developer based in Londen with a career in
            the Musicals. I have performed in several musicals on tour as well
            as on the West-End. Currently I have found an interest in coding and
            decided to give it a try. Following SheCodes's Max course I have
            been introduced and practiced in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap,
            GitHub, React, Hosting, API, VSCode. I have thoroughly enoyed the
            course and am hoping to find a job implementing these new learned
            skills.
